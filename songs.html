        Let me present you one of my favourite song and musicvideo of their newest album <a class="noeasylink" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noeasy">NOEASY</a>.
    </p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p class="membersname">Domino</p><br>
    <p class="songstext">
        Domino is one of the fourteen tracks of their newest album.
        It was written by 3Racha, a production team from the members of StrayKids.
        The song gives an boastful impression, but rightly so.
        StrayKids have shown to be trend-setters and incredibly influential, trough their incredible success they continue to impress.
        In their song Domino they also talk about the effects they have on the music industry and people who listen to and follow them, hence the 'domino effect'.

        <p class="membersname">Thunderous</p><br>
        <p class="songstext">Thunderous (소리꾼) is the lead single of the album and was released on august 23, 2021.
            It was written by 3Racha, a production team from the members of StrayKids.
            Thunderous was promoted on several South Korean music programs and took six wins from music programs.
            The song is described as a hiphop and trap song with the elements of Korean traditional music and brass instruments.
            The song expresses the firm belief that they will not be discouraged and keep to their principles no matter what anyone says.
